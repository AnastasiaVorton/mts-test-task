## Notes about the project

* The application is a [test task for МТС internship](https://hackmd.io/s/rJhM6SUdE#Тестовое-frontend-МТС-ИТ)
* The deployed application can be viewed and tested [here](https://areprintseva.tech)
* For now the functionality of the app is rather small and not all the extensions are available for conversion. Some 
most common file extensions were used in the app. More are to be added in future versions.
